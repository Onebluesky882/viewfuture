Relationship Between Documents

PROJECT.md — project identity and purpose.

ROADMAP.md — long-term direction, business goals, current progress, next steps.

PIPELINE.md — execution stages and implementation progress.

ARCHITECTURE.md — system structure.

CONTRACTS.md — interfaces and contracts.

DECISIONS.md — approved technical decisions.

AGENT_RULES.md — worker operating rules.

SECURITY_RULES.md — security requirements and restrictions.

CONDUCTOR.md — orchestration behavior.

DEV.md — Dev authority, overrides Conductor and Workers.

DEV_LOG.md — log of direct Dev edits; Conductor reconciles ROADMAP/PROJECT/PIPELINE against it.

Authority Order

Dev > Conductor > Workers.

Workers execute. Conductor coordinates. Dev directs.
